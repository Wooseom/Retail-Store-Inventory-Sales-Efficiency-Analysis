< Retail-Store-Inventory-Sales-Efficiency-Analysis >

As part of exploring retail demand behavior, this is a full SQL-driven analysis to uncover how each product performs across the four seasons. I measured sales patterns, forecast accuracy, and inventory efficiency to reveal peak seasons, fulfillment gaps, and overstock risks. This project highlights how data-driven insights can improve forecasting, procurement decisions, and seasonal inventory planning.

* Objectives
1) To assess seasonal demand patterns and unterstand how seasonality affects sales and inventory allocation
2) To analyze the relationship between inventory levels and sales performance across multiple retail products and seasons
3) To evaluate operational efficiency by comparing total inventory value including measurement of inventory health(low, balanced, overstock) with total sales value
4) To provide data-driven insights that help improve inventory planning, purchasing decisions, and overall operational efficiency

* Key Questions
1) How efficiency is the inventory being converted into sales?
2) which products demonstrate the highest operation efficiency and why?
3) which products reach their peak sales in each season?
4) Is the current inventory level appropriate compared to forecast demand?
5) What insights can be used to optimize purchasing and restocking strategies?
